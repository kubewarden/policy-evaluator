// API's that expose other crate types (such as Kubewarden Policy SDK
// or `policy_fetcher`) can either implement their own exposed types,
// and means to convert those types internally to their dependencies
// types, or depending on the specific case, re-export dependencies
// API's directly.
//
// Re-exporting specific crates that belong to us is easier for common
// consumers of these libraries along with the `policy-evaluator`, so
// they can access these crates through the `policy-evaluator` itself,
// streamlining their dependencies as well.
